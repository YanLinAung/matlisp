BLAS
====

The stock version of BLAS (and LAPACK) uses a function XERBLA to
handle error messages.  The stock version has a STOP statement in it
and that causes Lisp to exit.  

The version included in Matlisp has removed the STOP statement and
relies on the caller to return some error code to the caller.
This might be problem, but it works as expected for dgeev/zgeev.

LAPACK
======

The stock version of LAPACK has an apparent error in the routine
dgeev.  The workspace query doesn't work as the code comments say.
The version included with matlisp has this fixed by copying the
corresponding code from zgeev, which does work.

Build Issues
============

 Mac OS X
 ========
 o The stock version of m4 on Mac OS X 10.6 (and perhaps others) has a
   bug that causes m4 to crash, preventing autoreconf from working.
   You can upgrade m4 to from 1.4.6 (in OSX 10.6) to something newer.
   Or you can use a different version of autoreconf, like the version
   from MacPorts.
