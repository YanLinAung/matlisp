* Write documentation. Maybe move to TeXinfo (like femlisp).
  Fix the formatting for docstrings.
* Write tests
* Get the python-bridge working with burgled-batteries, nothing beats
  matplotlib for plotting.
* Add infix to Matlisp
* Support linking to libraries ? Might have to parse function declarations
  with cffi-grovel.
