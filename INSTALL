The current implementation of Matlisp relies on the foreign function 
interface of the free Common Lisp implementation CMUCL.  This means 
that Matlisp is available whenever CMUCL is.  In particular, Matlisp 
is tested with CMUCL on Sun/Solaris and Linux operating systems. 

An immediate goal is to make Matlisp available for CLISP -- another 
free Common Lisp implementation that is supported on a wider range of 
platforms than CMUCL. 

One of the design goals of Matlisp was to ensure the consistency of 
installation.  Matlisp is currently distributed as source code and the 
user must do a compilation.  A great deal of effort was put into a 
configure script that determines machine parameters, system libraries 
and without bothering the user. 

The installation follows in a few easy steps: 
                         
1. Download the Matlisp sources from http://matlisp.sourceforge.net
2. Unpack the source file

	gunzip matlisp.tgz 
	tar -vxf matlisp.tar

3. Change to that directory 

	cd matlisp

4. Configure your system

	./configure

5. Build the Fortran libraries BLAS/LAPACK

	make

6. Fire up CMU Common Lisp

	cmucl

7. Load Matlisp

	(load "start.lisp")
                       
That's all there is to it.  In order for this to work, configure must 
be able to detect a Fortran compiler and a C compiler in your path.  
This is usually the case.  If configure fails  you should contact your 
system administrator.

Enjoy!
