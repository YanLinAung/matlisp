Requirements:
=============
Either CMUCL (version 18b) or Allegro CL (version 5.0 or later)
is required.

* Allegro CL: Matlisp should compile on Linux, Solaris, Windows.
              In particular, Matlisp relies on the foreign
	      function interface of Allegro CL.

* CMU CL: Matlisp should compile on Linux, Solaris.
          In particular, Matlisp relies on the foreign function
          interface of CMU CL and the built-in type 
          kernel::complex-double-float.

An immediate goal is to make Matlisp available for CLISP -- another 
free Common Lisp implementation that is supported on a wider range of 
platforms than CMUCL and AllegroCL. 


Linux/Unix Installation:
========================

One of the design goals of Matlisp was to ensure the consistency of 
installation.  Matlisp is currently distributed as source code and the 
user must do a compilation.  A great deal of effort was put into a 
configure script that determines machine parameters, system libraries 
and without bothering the user. 

The installation follows in a few easy steps: 
                         
1. Download the Matlisp sources from http://matlisp.sourceforge.net
2. Unpack the source file

	gunzip matlisp.tgz 
	tar -vxf matlisp.tar

3. Change to that directory 

	cd matlisp

4a. Build the system for Allegro CL:

	make allegro

4b. Build the system for CMU CL:

	make cmu
                       
That's all there is to it.  In order for this to work, configure must 
be able to detect a Fortran compiler and a C compiler in your path.  
This is usually the case.  If configure fails  you should contact your 
system administrator.

For higher performance you may consider using optimized BLAS/LAPACK
libraries that may be available for your system.  For example,
the file lib/lazy-loader.lisp contains sample code that would
use the ATLAS (http://www.netlib.org/atlas) replacement library
for BLAS.

MS Windows installation:
========================

1. Download the Matlisp sources from http://matlisp.sourceforge.net
2. Unpack the source file
3. From within Allegro CL:

	(load "start.lisp")

That should be all.  The precompiled BLAS/LAPACK libraries were obtained
from http://www.che.chalmers.se/~agris/Programming/clapack/clapack.html

Unfortunately, we currently do not support the functions FFT, IFFT
which rely of DFFTPACK for MSWindows.

Enjoy!
